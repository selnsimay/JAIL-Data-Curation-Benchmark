## Overview
**JAIL-Data-Curation-Benchmark** focuses on the curation of various biological datasets, including gene information, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and biochemical reactions. These curated datasets are intended to serve as a foundation for training and evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to understand and retrieve specific biological information. The project includes scripts for data fetching, processing, formatting into question-answer pairs, and an example notebook for LLM evaluation using the DeepEval framework.

The core aim of the JAIL-Data-Curation-Benchmark is to:
*   **Curate High-Quality Biological Datasets:** Systematically gather and process information about human genes, Gene Ontology terms, and biochemical reactions from public databases.
*   **Prepare Data for LLM Training:** Transform curated data into formats suitable for supervised fine tuning, such as question-answer pairs.

## Key Components
### Notebooks
1. **`notebooks/20240823_LLMeval_test_deepeval-checkpoint.ipynb`**
    *   **Purpose:** To demonstrate and test the DeepEval framework for LLM evaluation.
    *   **Description:** Sets up a custom Llama 3.1 70B model and uses DeepEval's `HallucinationMetric`. This notebook is more self-contained for its example but could be adapted to use the curated datasets.
    *   **Status:** "Currently on pause."

2. **`notebooks/20241007_GOterm_Information_Dataset_Dictionary.ipynb`**
    *   **Purpose:** To create [Gene Ontology Term Dataset](#gene-ontology-term-dataset).

3. **`notebooks/20241017Gene_Dataset.ipynb`**
    *   **Purpose:** To create [Gene Information Dataset](#gene-information-dataset).

4. **`/notebooks/20250219Gene_Reactions_Dataset.ipynb`**
    *   **Purpose:** To create [Gene Pathway Dataset](#gene-pathway-dataset).

### Datasets
#### Gene Ontology Term Dataset

A structured dataset of Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the **Biological Process (BP)** namespace.

- **Fields Included:**
  - `go_id`: Gene Ontology ID (e.g., GO:0008150)
  - `name`: GO term name
  - `definition`: Description of the biological process
  - `information_content`: A score indicating specificity of the term
  - `associated_genes`: List of gene symbols linked to the GO term

---

#### Gene Information Dataset

Gene metadata curated using the **HGNC gene list** (as of *2024-10-01*) and enriched via the **MyGene.info API**.

- **Fields Included:**
  - `ensembl_id`: ENSEMBL gene identifier
  - `symbol`: Official gene symbol (e.g., TP53)
  - `aliases`: Alternate gene symbols
  - `name`: Full gene name
  - `other_names`: Synonyms and other designations
  - `description`: Functional summary (if available)

---

#### Gene Pathway Dataset

Biochemical pathway data extracted from the **Reactome database** for human genes.

- **Fields Included:**
  - `gene_id`: ENSEMBL or HGNC identifier
  - `pathways`: List of pathways the gene participates in
  - `reactions`: List of biochemical reactions associated with each pathway
  - `participants`: Grouped by:
    - `inputs`: Molecules consumed in the reaction
    - `outputs`: Molecules produced
    - `catalysts`: Entities that facilitate the reaction
    - `regulators`: Positive/negative regulators involved

### Scripts
1.  **`scripts/20250404GeneInfo_DataFormatting.py`**
    *   **Purpose:** To transform a structured gene information dataset (JSON) into a list of question-answer pairs.
    *   **Description:** This script reads a JSON file containing detailed information for multiple genes (expected from `data/geneset_dict.json`). It then iterates through each gene entry and, using a predefined mapping of question templates to JSON keys, generates specific questions about each gene. The corresponding values from the gene's data are used as answers.

## Neo4j Setup and Querying

Neo4j setup and Reactome database can be found here: https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database#GetStarted

1. Install Reactome graph database and graph database dump file
2. Download and install the Neo4j V4
        Version used for this repository: **neo4j-community-4.4.40**
3. Install the Graph Database for Mac/Linux users.
4. Extract the **Reactome.graph.db** after downloading.
5. Move **graph.db** folder to ``/path/to/neo4j/data/databases/``
6. Rename the folder to the graph.db.
7. Config Neo4j
8. Edit Neo4j confirmation file in ``/path/to/neo4j/conf/neo4j.conf``
9. It's recommended having all these settings:
```
    dbms.default_database=graph.db
    dbms.recovery.fail_on_missing_files=false
    unsupported.dbms.tx_log.fail_on_corrupted_log_files=false
```
10. Run ``./path//neo4j/bin/neo4j-admin load --force --from=/path/reactome.graphdb.dump --database=graph.db``
11. Start Neo4j ``./path/to/neo4j/bin/neo4j start``

**Note:** After starting neo4j, you can listen in on the neo4j port from DGX by running the following command (make sure you are in the directory where neo4j is in)
``ssh -L 7474:localhost:7474 -L 7687:localhost:7687``

Information on how to query reactome database using Neo4j can be found here: https://reactome.org/dev/graph-database/extract-participating-molecules#retrieving-reactions

**Note:** Create a `.env` file in the **root directory** of the `JAIL-Data-Curation-Benchmark` project with your Neo4j credentials:
        ```env
        # JAIL-Data-Curation-Benchmark/.env
        URI="bolt://your_neo4j_host:7687"
        USERNAME="your_neo4j_username"
        PASSWORD="your_neo4j_password"
        ```

12. When done, Stop Neo4j ``./path/to/neo4j/bin/neo4j stop``

# JAIL-Data-Curation-Benchmark
## Overview
**JAIL-Data-Curation-Benchmark** focuses on the curation of various biological datasets, including gene information, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and biochemical reactions. These curated datasets are intended to serve as a foundation for training and evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to understand and retrieve specific biological information. The project includes scripts for data fetching, processing, formatting into question-answer pairs, and an example notebook for LLM evaluation using the DeepEval framework.

The core aim of the JAIL-Data-Curation-Benchmark is to:
*   **Curate High-Quality Biological Datasets:** Systematically gather and process information about human genes, Gene Ontology terms, and biochemical reactions from public databases.
*   **Prepare Data for LLM Interaction:** Transform curated data into formats suitable for supervised fine tuning, such as question-answer pairs.

To ensure the scripts and notebooks run as intended with their current relative file paths (e.g., `../data/some_file.json`), the following directory structure is recommended at the root of your project:
```
